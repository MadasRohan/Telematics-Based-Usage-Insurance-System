# Telematics-Based Insurance System
This Python project simulates a telematics-based insurance system that analyzes driving behavior to adjust insurance premiums dynamically. It generates realistic driving data, detects risky driving events, calculates risk scores, adjusts premiums, and provides personalized safety recommendations.

## Key Features
-🚗 Telematics Data Generation: Simulates realistic driving data for different risk profiles
-⚠️ Driving Behavior Analysis: Detects events like hard braking, rapid acceleration, speeding, etc.
-📊 Risk Scoring: Calculates comprehensive risk scores based on driving behavior
-💰 Premium Adjustment: Dynamically adjusts insurance premiums using a sensitive pricing model
-🛡️ Safety Recommendations: Provides personalized feedback to improve driving safety
-🔒 Privacy Protection: Anonymizes driver IDs using SHA-256 hashing
-⏱️ Dynamic Trip Durations: Generates realistic trip durations (short, medium, long)

## How It Works:

-Data Generation: Creates simulated telematics data (speed, acceleration, road type)
-Behavior Analysis: Detects risky driving events and patterns
-Risk Scoring: Calculates a comprehensive risk score (0-100)
-Premium Adjustment: Adjusts base premium based on risk score
-Feedback Generation: Provides safety recommendations based on driving behavior

## Requirements
-Python 3.6+
-Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)
